  Project:     Ch16Prb2.csprj
  Source File: Ch16Prb2.cs
  Purpose:     Created as coursework for data structures course to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem using fathoming. 
               Illustrates using a BackgroundWorker object to execute a processor-intensive and long-running method
               in the background, freeing up the UI to display a processing animation.

  Purpose:     Created as coursework for artifical intelligence course to revisit the 0-1 knapsack problem using a recursive solution.
               This uses minimal pruning. This is a O(2^n) algorithm.
